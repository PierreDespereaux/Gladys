I love corgis, they're the best. I have wanted to make a little corgi follower for the longest time, but I have been held back by my lack of assets. However, [Adventurer1111](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/49731726) has recently added a corgi to his mod [Dovahkiin Dogs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40885) and he has been ever so nice to not only [let me use his edited mesh, but to also buy me usage rights from the original authors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PierreDespereaux/PierreDespereaux/master/assets/images/gladys/Corgi%20Permissions.PNG)!

So I present to you Gladys, a fierce working dog that will happily bite the heels of your enemies! Talk to the new merchant at the Solitude Docks to begin your adventures together!

-   A new adorable corgi follower named Gladys.
-   A unique model and armor set to make her stand out from the rest of Skyrim's dogs.
-   A looting system that will allow Gladys to retrieve useful items from the surrounding environment.
-   A home framework that will allow you to tell Gladys where to live when dismissed.
-   The ability to play fetch!
-   Fully re-voiced sound effects using audio from my own pet corgis!
