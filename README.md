I love corgis, they're the best. I have wanted to make a little corgi follower for the longest time, but I have been held back by my lack of assets. However, [Adventurer1111](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/49731726) has recently added a corgi to his mod [Dovahkiin Dogs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40885) and he has been ever so nice to not only let me use his edited mesh, but to also buy me usage rights from the original authors!

So I present to you Gladys, a fierce working dog that will happily bite the heels of your enemies! Talk to the new merchant at the Solitude Docks to begin your adventures together!

-   A new adorable corgi follower named Gladys.
-   A unique model and armor set to make her stand out from the rest of Skyrim's dogs.
-   A looting system that will allow Gladys to retrieve useful items from the surrounding environment.
-   A home framework that will allow you to tell Gladys where to live when dismissed.
-   The ability to play fetch!
-   Fully re-voiced sound effects using audio from my own pet corgis!\

This mod adds a merchant ship to the Solitude docks in front of the East Empire Company Warehouse. This ship is only there before purchasing Gladys from the merchant, afterward she will leave and take the ship with her. I carefully chose the location of this new ship to ensure that it wouldn't conflict with any of the popular Solitude mods.
