I love corgis, they're the best. I have wanted to make a little corgi follower for the longest time but have been held back by my lack of assets. However, Adventurer1111 has recently added a corgi to his mode Dovahkiin Dogs and has been ever so nice to not only let me use his edited mesh but also buying me the rights to use it from the original authors!

So I present to you Gladys a fierce working dog that will happily bite the heels of your enemies!

- A new adorable corgi follower named Gladys.
- A short quest to aquire the new pet.
- A unique model to make her stand out from the rest of Skyrim's dogs.
- Fully re-voiced sound effects using audio from my own pet corgis!
