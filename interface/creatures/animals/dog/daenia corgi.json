    "description": "The Glenumbran Corgi is a hardy working Dog from High Rock that is renowned for their intelligence and natural herding ability. There are two breeds of Glenumbran Corgi: the Daenia Glenumbran Corgi and the Cambray Glenumbran Corgi.\n\nThe Daenia Corgi has been a beloved companion of the Daggerfall royal family for over a century, beginning with Princess Imogneâ€™s first Dog, Gwendoline. All subsequent Royal Corgis are direct descendants of Gwendoline, and the breed has become an unofficial symbol of the Daggerfall monarchy."
